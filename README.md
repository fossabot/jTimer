# jTimer

## How it work

When you use jTimer for get time with a structure that contains second you run an interval of 1 second, but when you use it for get time with a structure that contain: (minute you run an interval of 60 second, hours ==> interval of 3600 second, day, month....).
* So it improve perfomance by reducing the interval.
